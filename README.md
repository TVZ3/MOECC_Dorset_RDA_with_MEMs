# MOECC_Dorset_RDA_with_MEMs
Organising data and running a redundancy analysis with variation partitioning on Dorset Algae Community data.  The redundancy analysis is plotted and the variation partitioning results are posted in the html in the page description.

Update 28/06/2017 - I have also added an RMD file explaining how to make the results from the variation partitioning more interpretable. Essentially, This RMD shows how to take the results from the variation partitioning analysis and put them into a bar graph rather than portraying them in a Venn diagram
